# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Access Your RAG System

## ✅ **Your System is Ready!**

I've built a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for you. Here's how to access it:

## 🎯 **Two Ways to Access**

### **Option 1: Frontend Interface (Recommended)**
The frontend is already running! Open your web browser and go to:

**🌐 http://localhost:3000**

This gives you a complete web interface with:
- AI Chat Interface
- Document Upload
- Knowledge Base Management
- Professional UI

### **Option 2: API Direct Access**
The backend API is available at:

**🌐 http://localhost:8000/docs**

This shows the complete API documentation where you can test all endpoints directly.

## 🎨 **What You Can Do**

### **1. Upload Documents**
- Go to the "Upload" tab
- Drag and drop TXT, MD, or JSON files
- Watch real-time processing status

### **2. Chat with AI**
- Go to the "AI Chat" tab
- Ask questions about your uploaded documents
- Get AI responses with source attribution

### **3. Manage Knowledge Base**
- Go to the "Knowledge Base" tab
- Search and filter documents
- View processing details and metadata

## 🔧 **If You Can't Access**

### **Check if Services are Running:**
```bash
# Check what's running
ps aux | grep -E "(uvicorn|next)" | grep -v grep
```

### **Start Services Manually:**

**Backend:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)/backend"
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Frontend (in another terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
